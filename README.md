# FunShaders
3 simple shaders on the stanford armadillo; some shaders interact with the ball under the armadillo.

#Controls
WASD to move the ball.
Press 'T' and 'G' to increase/decrease the radius of the interference magnet in the remote.
Press 1, 2, or 3 to change the Shader combination.

#Shaders:
1 - Red - 'Burning Armadillo Festival'
             Noise based on vertex position.
             Upward facing normals extended to look like fire.
             Displacement of the fire vertices to simulate fire.
             Colour changed to orange/yellow.

2 - Green - 'Lend me your power, green glowy ball of hope'
             Colour change in waves from the remote.
             Face Normals expand the armadillo among the same waves.
             Remote also makes bright the armadillo when close.

3 - Blue - 'Fatal Fang: Armadillo of black water'
             Noise based on vertex position.
             Downward facing normals changed into slowly melting cloak.
             Displacement of the vertices in waves to simulate wind.
             Colour decreased to be more black, more blue.
